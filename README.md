# NexusAutoDL
This tool is designed for automating the process of downloading mods from [Nexusmods](https://www.nexusmods.com/), without being a premium member. It is designed with mod managers such as [Portmod](https://gitlab.com/portmod/portmod) and [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/). It also contains an integration for Nexusmods own mod manager, [Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/), which contrary to the affore mentioned, does not automatically open the mods download page but instead forces users to suffer through another click. This tool is designed to automatically click through a download list and download all of the contained mods without user intervention.
